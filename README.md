## Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a field of study that aims to identify and extract subjective information from textual data. In this project, we focus on sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews using advanced deep learning techniques and pre-trained word embeddings from TensorFlow Hub. By harnessing the power of deep learning models, the project enables automatic sentiment classification of movie reviews, providing valuable insights into audience opinions.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the sentiment analysis, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- TensorFlow Datasets
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub tensorflow_datasets numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file [`IMDB_Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis_with_TensorFlow_and_Hub.ipynb`](IMDB_Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis_with_TensorFlow_and_Hub.ipynb).
2. Install the required dependencies (see the Installation section).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, etc.).
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code and perform sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews.
5. Analyze the printed output and visualizations to gain insights into the sentiment classification and model performance.

## Results

The notebook presents the training and evaluation results of the sentiment analysis model. It displays the training and validation loss over the epochs, as well as the training and validation accuracy. Furthermore, it evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset and reports the corresponding loss and accuracy values. By examining these results, you can assess the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis model in classifying IMDB movie reviews.
