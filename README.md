## Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves extracting subjective information from textual data. This Jupyter Notebook showcases a state-of-the-art deep learning approach to sentiment analysis, employing the TensorFlow framework and pre-trained word embeddings from TensorFlow Hub. By leveraging the IMDB movie reviews dataset, the model learns to discern sentiment and classify reviews as positive or negative.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- TensorFlow Datasets
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub tensorflow_datasets numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file [](IMDB_Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis_with_TensorFlow_and_Hub.ipynb).
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (see the Installation section).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, etc.).
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code step by step.
5. Follow the printed output and visualizations to understand the model training process and evaluate the results.

## Results

The notebook presents the training and evaluation results of the sentiment analysis model. It displays the training and validation loss over the epochs, as well as the training and validation accuracy. Finally, it evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset and prints the loss and accuracy values.
